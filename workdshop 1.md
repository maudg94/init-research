## 1. Smart Home Energy Management Systems in Internet of Things networks for green cities demands and services

[Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352186421000912)

**Abstract** : 
Today, 44% of global energy has been derived from fossil fuel, which currently poses a threat to inhabitants and well-being of the environment. In a recent investigation of the global demand for energy consumption across various energy consumption sectors, the building sector has been shown to be one of the primary energy consumers, with a high percentage of energy consumption deemed as unnecessary. This as a result of poor management practice and implementation of strategies to avoid excess energy consumption. Over the years, researchers in both academia and industries have focused on various techniques to deal with unnecessary energy consumption and ensuring a healthy living environment for green smart cities. Among these techniques is Smart Home Energy Management Systems (SHEMs), which transform electric home appliances, sensor nodes, into autonomous devices in order to manage energy consumption effectively. This study presents an analysis of smart home energy management system with the goal to identify current trends and challenges for future improvement. The result reveals lack of quality attributes such as security, privacy, scalability, interoperability, and difficulty in managing and adapt to the thermal comfort satisfaction of residents, exposing them to health risks. Lastly, the study described opportunities for future research that ensure energy-efficient smart homes free of unnecessary energy consumption, health challenges, and cyber security attacks.

> **Abstract** : 
> 
> Enterprise architecture for smart cities is the focus of the research project “EADIC - (Developing an Enterprise Architecture for Digital Cities)” which is the context of the reported results in this work. We report in detail the results of a survey we contacted. Using these results we identify important quality and functional requirements for smart cities. Important quality properties include interoperability, usability, security, availability, recoverability and maintainability. We also observe business-related issues such as an apparent uncertainty on who is selling services, the lack of business plan in most cases and uncertainty in commercialization of services. At the software architecture domain we present a conceptual architectural framework based on architectural patterns which address the identified quality requirements. The conceptual framework can be used as a starting point for actual smart cities’ projects.

## 3. Development of an enterprise Geographic Information System (GIS) integrated with smart grid

[Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2352467717302564)

> **Abstract** :
> 
> This article uses a Geographical Information System (GIS) platform to create an on-line monitoring system in order to display real-time operational data measured at different points of an electricity network. The network with all its assets will be displayed on a geographical map. This provides the electricity utilities with a tool for monitoring, control, asset management, and demand side management in a smart grid. The system is tested as a pilot using the low-voltage network at Sultan Qaboos University (SQU), Oman. The article illustrates the pilot implementation of an enterprise GIS for application in smart grids, where the technical procedures of development phases of GIS data model and GIS web application have been described in details. The developed system produces spatial representation of the electricity network and its assets including renewable energy systems with their operational data on the map of existing electrical distribution network. It provides the utilities the ability to monitor the system components and their operation performance in real time with their location on a map.

## 4. A systematic review of the smart energy conservation system: From smart homes to sustainable smart cities

[Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364032121000502)

> **Abstract** :
> 
> In recent years, smart cities have emerged with energy conservation systems for managing energy in cities as well as buildings. Although many studies on energy conservation systems of smart homes have already been conducted, energy management at the city level is still a challenge due to the various building types and complex infrastructure. Therefore, this paper investigated the research themes on smart homes and cities through a quantitative review and identified barriers to the progression of smart homes to sustainable smart cities through a qualitative review. Based on the results of the holistic framework of each domain (smart home and city) and the techno-functional barriers, this study suggests that the following innovative solutions be suitably applied to advanced energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities: (i) construction of infrastructure for advanced energy conservation systems, and (ii) adoption of a new strategy for energy trading in distributed energy systems. Especially, to reflect consumer behavior and energy in sustainable smart cities, the following responses to future research challenges according to the “bottom-up approach (smart home level to smart city level)” are proposed: (i) development of real-time energy monitoring, diagnostics and controlling technologies; (ii) application of intelligent energy management technologies; and (iii) implementation of integrated energy network technologies at the city level. This paper is expected to play a leading role as a knowledge-based systematic guide for future research on the implementation of energy conservation systems in sustainable smart cities.

## 5. Towards Effective BIM/GIS Data Integration for Smart City by Integrating Computer Graphics Technique

[Link](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/13/10/1889)

> **Abstract** :
> 
> The development of a smart city and digital twin requires the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), where BIM models are to be integrated into GIS for visualization and/or analysis. However, the intrinsic differences between BIM and GIS have led to enormous problems in BIM-to-GIS data conversion, and the use of City Geography Markup Language (CityGML) has further escalated this issue. This study aims to facilitate the use of BIM models in GIS by proposing using the shapefile format, and a creative approach for converting Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) to shapefile was developed by integrating a computer graphics technique. Thirteen building models were used to validate the proposed method. The result shows that: (1) the IFC-to-shapefile conversion is easier and more flexible to realize than the IFC-to-CityGML conversion, and (2) the computer graphics technique can improve the efficiency and reliability of BIM-to-GIS data conversion. This study can facilitate the use of BIM information in GIS and benefit studies working on digital twins and smart cities where building models are to be processed and integrated in GIS, or any other studies that need to manipulate IFC geometry in depth.

## 6. The Role of Internet of Things and Smart Grid for the Development of a Smart City

[Link](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-5523-2_3)

> **Abstract** :
>
> The smart grid (SG) and Internet of things (IoT) are arguably most important feature in any smart city (SC). If energy unavailable for a significant period of time, all other associated functions will be eventually affected. On the other side, IoT ensures integration of diversified networks, wireless technologies, and appliances.
This enables smart communication between various devices, so that they can smartly communicate with each other. Smart city is one of the applications of IoT. Smart city encompasses improved infrastructure for better economic growth and quality life style. Recent technological trends have led to the rise in demand for efficient communication between devices without any human intervention, thus creating a huge market for IoT. With the abundance of opportunities for growth, every developed country, even some of the developing countries, are now come up with their own fully funded IoT projects. This paper summarized the role of IoT for the development of smart city and also presents architecture for the smart city for efficient utilization of infrastructure and challenges of IoT infrastructure development with their solution; further it enlists applications of IoT based on their domain.

## 7. OpenADR open source toolkit: Developing open source software for the Smart Grid

[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6039816)

> **Abstract** :
>
> Demand response (DR) is becoming an increasingly important part of power grid planning and operation. The advent of the Smart Grid, which mandates its use, further motivates selection and development of suitable software protocols to enable DR functionality. The OpenADR protocol has been developed and is being standardized to serve this goal. We believe that the development of a distributable, open source implementation of OpenADR will benefit this effort and motivate critical evaluation of its capabilities, by the wider community, for providing wide-scale DR services.

## 8. Simulation of a Smart Grid City with Software Agents

[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5358746)

> **Abstract** :
>
> In the future smart city, new information and communication technologies will enable a better management of the available resources. The future smart grid infrastructure is emerging as a complex system where fine-grained monitoring and control of energy generating and/or consuming entities within the electricity network is possible. This will result to better approaches that will boost energy efficiency. A simulation of a dynamic ecosystem such as the smart city, will enable us to test new concepts and resource-optimization approaches. Therefore we have analyzed, designed, and build a simulator based on software agents that attempts to create the dynamic behavior of a smart city. It simulates discrete heterogeneous devices that consume and/or produce energy, that are able to act autonomously and collaborate. The behavior of these devices and their groupings e.g. smart houses, has been modeled in order to map as near as possible the real behavior patterns of the respective physical objects.

## 9. Distributed Software Infrastructure for General Purpose Services in Smart Grid

[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6979255)

> **Abstract** :
>
> In this paper, the design of an event-driven middleware for general purpose services in smart grid (SG) is presented. The main purpose is to provide a peer-to-peer distributed software infrastructure to allow the access of new multiple and authorized actors to SGs information in order to provide new services. To achieve this, the proposed middleware has been designed to be: 1) event-based; 2) reliable; 3) secure from malicious information and communication technology attacks; and 4) to enable hardware independent interoperability between heterogeneous technologies. To demonstrate practical deployment, a numerical case study applied to the whole U.K. distribution network is presented, and the capabilities of the proposed infrastructure are discussed.

## 10. An Analysis of Security and Privacy Issues in Smart Grid Software Architectures on Clouds

[Link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6008758)

> **Abstract** :
>
> Power utilities globally are increasingly upgrading to Smart Grids that use bi-directional communication with the consumer to enable an information-driven approach to distributed energy management. Clouds offer features well suited for Smart Grid software platforms and applications, such as elastic resources and shared services. However, the security and privacy concerns inherent in an information-rich Smart Grid environment are further exacerbated by their deployment on Clouds. Here, we present an analysis of security and privacy issues in a Smart Grids software architecture operating on different Cloud environments, in the form of a taxonomy. We use the Los Angeles Smart Grid Project that is underway in the largest U.S. municipal utility to drive this analysis that will benefit both Cloud practitioners targeting Smart Grid applications, and Cloud researchers investigating security and privacy.

## 11. Mitigating Household Energy Poverty through Energy Expenditure Affordability Algorithm in a Smart Grid

[Link](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/11/4/947/htm)

> **Abstract** :
>
> One of the criteria for measuring household energy poverty is the percentage of the household’s income spent on energy expenses. In this work, an autonomous income-based energy scheduling demand side management (DSM) technique called energy expenditure affordability algorithm (EEAA) is proposed to ensure that household energy expenditure is below the nation’s approved energy expenditure threshold. The EEAA problem was formulated as a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem and verified with real household data collected from families living in bachelor flats in Johannesburg, South Africa. Consumer preferences and satisfaction were enhanced by using the dynamic time warping (DTW) technique to minimize the distance between nominal and EEAA load profiles. Furthermore, the effects of distributed energy generation (DEG) and distributed energy storage (DES) were also investigated in light of energy expenditure affordability for improved consumer-friendly and satisfying DSM. The EEAA-DSM technique is shown to reduce household energy expenditure below the energy expenditure threshold, offering energy expenditure affordability as well as utility grid peak demand reduction (PDR). Furthermore, grid reliability and sustainability, environmental preservation and gendered energy poverty are consequential benefits of the EEAA. It also offered the households considered an average financial savings from 12% to 82%, depending on the level of implementation of distributed storage and generation to the consumer’s local energy mix.

# Q5 



# Q7

## Smart 

The most common sens of **smart** is intelligent. In the context of a technical solution, **smart** means a solution which is adaptable, leveraging advanced algorithm and engineering techniques to solve difficult problems that could not tradionnaly be automated.

## Grid

A grid in this context refers to an electric grid, a network of transmission lines, substations transformers and others that deliver electricity from the power plant to the houses or businesses. It is what aliments your houses for all its electricity needs (lights, computers, ...).

## Smart Grid

A smart grid is an electrical grid which includes a variety of operation and energy measures including:

- Advanced metering infrastructure 
- Smart distribution boards and circuit breakers integrated with home control and demand response
- Load control switches and smart appliances, often financed by efficiency gains on municipal programs
- Renewable energy resources, including capacity to charge parked batteries or larger arrays of batteries recycled from these, or other energy storage
- Energy efficient resources
- Sufficient utility grade fiber broadband to connect and monitor the above, with wireless as backup. Sufficient spare if "dark" capacity to ensure failover, often leased for revenue. 

## Geographic Information System (GIS)

A geographic information system (GIS) is a conceptualized framework that provides the ability to capture and analyze spatial and geographic data. GIS applications (or GIS apps) are computer-based tools that allow the user to create interactive queries (user-created searches), store and edit spatial and non-spatial data, analyze spatial information output, and visually share the results of these operations by presenting them as maps.

# Q8

How information system architecture can help create a sustainable power grid for the smart city ?
